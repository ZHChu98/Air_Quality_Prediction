# **Air Quality Prediction**

Project for Machine Learning

## **Brief Description**

Air pollution is a serious environmental issue that is attracting increasing attention globally. Hence, it is necessary to conduct air quality prediction to better reflect the changing trend of air pollution, and to provide prompt and comprehensive environmental information. Our main objective is to develop a deep learning approach for quality prediction, considering the spatial and temporal
correlations of air quality data simultaneously.

## **Project Structure**

1. Read and clean the data using *Pandas*
2. Analysis data based on their datetime and location and visualize the data via *Matplotlib*
3. Implement supervised deep regression model, such as MLP, SAE, RNN, to predict the air quality based on previous data using *PyTorch*
4. Tune the model and summary the result
